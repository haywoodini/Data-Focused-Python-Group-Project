1. Firstly Download our zip file and load to a repository that you want, which we name here **'download_repository'**

2. Our product uses 3 datasources for petfood recommendation, providing the customized petfood suggestions from the main shopping websites.
   a. the Amazon top 6 pages shopping data (web scraped)
   b. the Reddit sentimental comments of main Manufactuers (web scraped)
   c. the Manufactuer sales rank data (download from api)

3. To streamline the process, we have already got the raw data and cleaned data processed by our pipelines in the file.
   But if you want to check the validity of our scrape code, you can still run it, but it is gonna take a while.
   The web scraping files are listed below:
   
   ----- Do not Recommend to Run -----
   Web_Crwaler_Amazon_Data.py
   Web_Crwaler_Reddit_Data.py

4. To preprocess of data, we build the pipeline files to transform the data format into our desired formats.
   We also covered our pipeline files here, but still we have cleaned the data for you. If you want to run it that can also be done.

   ----- Do not Recommend to Run -----
   Data_Pipeline_Amazon.py
   Data_Pipeline_Reddit.py

5. After obtaining the required data, we also wrote a database buiding and data upload scipts in the files.
   It is been encapsulated into our main_launcher file.
   
   ----- Do not Recommend to Run -----
   DB_buidling.py

6. After the preparations are done, we have our ui file as the final product output, in the file folder named as prototype_ui.py
   It is also been encapsulated into our main_launcher file.
