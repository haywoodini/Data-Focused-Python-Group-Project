You are not a bad parent if you feed kibble/prescription diet,eyoitme,"instagram has discovered that i am a dog owner and i’ve been getting nonstop boutique food ads and it makes me so fucking mad bc they act like they’re angels and they’re saving our dogs from their stupid humans when the reality is is that they don’t give a single fuck about our babies. they’ll just do anything they want to get you to not only buy their food but buy into the fact that science is evil and that their unqualified ass opinion is the gospel. and the kicker? they can’t even provide basic nutrition for your pup bc the only thing they care about is money, so who cares if dogs are dying from their food as long as they’re making money. im not stoked about buying my pups food from nestle for obvious reasons lol but honestly these boutique brands are just as bad if not worse. like nestle sucks but at least purina knows how to make dog food. i got my pup about a month ago and she was underweight bc she was on the streets but also bc she had tapeworm and i put her on hills puppy and some kind of purina puppy food and when we got rid of the tapeworm she went from 9lbs to 12.5lbs in like a week bc she was getting such good nutrition and never once did she have any of the GI problems that ppl have been talking about on this post

but the other thing i hate about these brands is just how effective they are in making you feel like shit for not feeding your dog their food. like i went to my local (boutique-y) pet store to pick up some more food for my pup and i was specifically looking for purina but i would’ve taken any one of the 5 wsava compliant brands right. i did think that they might not have purina bc it wasn’t fancy enough for the store lol but i was like surely they have hills or at least royal canin right? nope. spent 20 minutes walking around the store and they only had the boutique brands with the raw or whole or grain free and whatever the fuck foods. not a single bag of anything from any of the 5 brands. and then i felt like shit for walking out of there without her food bc it felt like i was cheating out on her and not getting her the best i could, even tho i knew that wasn’t true bc their marketing is just that effective

anyways all that to say good on you for finally breaking free of that toxic culture op!! it must’ve been a hell of a cognitive dissonance to realize that the foods you trusted whole heartedly were the ones hurting your pup and the so called “evil” foods were the one your pup needed to be healthy bc a lot of ppl just can’t look past the lies they’re told by these scummy companies but you did it and your baby is going to be so much happier and healthier now bc of you <3",7,0.075096962,puppy food
Explain like I'm 5: why are we trusting WSAVA?,mxwashington7,"I think WSAVA it's important. I have an MS in Food Science and I worked for a pet food company, but didn't know it existed until recently.

I worked for a ""boutique"" brand that you probably haven't heard of unless you're from where I'm from.

At the company I worked for, I was in charge of quality control. And let me tell you, people would rather produce an unsafe product for the sake of having product in the market than slow down production to have a safer product.

So I think having a third-party with guidelines ultimately provides more piece of mind.",5,0.074074074,ultima
Just switched from Farmer's Dog to kibble,LeoLibra20,"I did consider a food intolerance/allergy. Farmer's Dog has 3-4 different recipes-- they all had the same problems with my dog. 

Ultimately, locating if there's a single ingredients causing his issues didn't matter to me. I decided that I'm not a vet/scientist, and that I would leave vet nutrition science up to those who practice it which is why I switched my dog off of fresh food completely. I think the vets above it articulated the reason why it's safer to feed dogs from those heavily-tested brands opposed to to homemade food/fresh food. When making this choice, every resource and vet pointed to fresh food as a whole being the problem -- not just any single ingredient. It's just not as scientifically tested to be safe for dogs regardless of what supplements or ingredients you use. 

But at the end of the day its a choice pet owners make. Some people feed their dogs homemade/fresh food and their dogs seem healthy on it! Personally, feeding my dog fresh/homemade food is a huge risk that I didin't want to take with my dog. He's doing so much better now that he's off of fresh food.",3,0.192633929,Ultima
Vent/Rant about Grain Free vs Normal Dog Food,Ocel0tte,"I remember when it became popular, years back. I felt so lost trying to find answers, when the problem was they aren't there because there's nothing backing those brands. Grr!

We fed my childhood dogs Eukanuba, then I got a dog and she's been on Zignature her whole life. I could've paid so much less, for better. I'm trying not to be bummed, she's been healthy and everything but she's part doberman so it's not a great mix to have gone grain free for so long. I listened to people at the shelter, and the pet store people. I grew up wanting to be a vet, duh, I should've just listened to the vets. I wasn't even trying to be grain free, I was just listening to nonsense.

It is what it is. Hopefully we have a lot of years left. She likes the Pro Plan a lot, and her poop looks good so it seems to be treating her well. I had some Zignature left and ran out of the small Pro Plan I got as a trial run, and she literally abandoned her bowl. She has a slow feeder because she eats like she's never been fed before, and has never refused food, but she straight up said no way.

I haven't decided what variety to stick with, I got the active one so it wasn't too much of a change for her. She is old now but still bouncy, and has been getting a daily joint supplement for 3yrs now so idk if I actually need senior food. She's not quite as trim as before, but I can't tell if she's chubby or has old lady skin lol.

Ultimately that dentist did so much harm, imo. A lot of ""dog people"" fell for it. Idk when it started coming back around to WSAVA, I'm a little slow to catch stuff sometimes so hopefully it's permeating and changing others' minds as well.",5,0.064583333,Ultima

Do not use Farmer’s Dog! It can give your dog pancreatitis!,neat_Professional431,"We put our Perfectly healthy 6 year old French Bulldog on Farmers Dog 9 months ago and we were thrilled with it.  She loved the food and starting losing weight.  The vet was thrilled with her new physique and we thought and believed we were doing a wonderful thing.  She seemed to beg for food daily in a way she never had before.  After contacting Farmers Dog to confirm we were giving her the correct dose for her breed and weight we moved forward feeling good that we were investing in our dogs health and doing things the right way.

Last weekend she woke up one morning vomiting so we took her in to the vet and after a blood test they confirmed that she had the signs of Pancreatitis and sent us home with some medication.  She refused to resume eating so the next morning we took her to the emergency vet and were told that her liver numbers were extremely elevated now.  She was admitted to the hospital and received an ultrasound that confirmed she had Pancreatitis but also showed signs of a GI tract issue.  Later that night she experienced respiratory complications ultimately leading to cardiac arrest.

  
We lost our baby 36 hours ago and I don't know why. I hope it wasn't Farmers Dog but I wasn't aware of this thread until now and if I had known I never would have used this product.

Everyone makes money and no one knows the TRUTH. I compared it to something I already had experience with. Feeding children/myself. Have I eaten a lot of balogna sandwhiches yes I have and hot dogs too as a kid. Did anyone know they weren’t good for me when given.. not really. At least not in my neighborhood and family circle. Am I suffering poor health no, could potentially from it sure..would I ever know: NO. I’ve also eaten a lot of “healthy” vegetables that could’ve and probably were tainted with pesticides! Yes I have. Will we all die..yes we will from something with true cause unknown: definitely. It will be the same with your canine love. She/he is going to pass away and your not going to know why/how and if you did anything to cause it… give her/him your very best decision you can make in that moment..until your sure otherwise. Feed a little of them all if your concerned one isn’t good. Variety in diet ensures the best range of nutrients anyway.. if they get some crappy food it’s not going to make or break their nutrition. Being shorted on clean water, parasite infections, little exercise, little interaction with people and other dogs probably cause more problems than what a dog eats.

I just don't know anymore.,Dependent-Water-338,"I'm not a big fan of hills They were good for my dog as a puppy. However, I am open to recommendations from vets. I trust my dog because she has very picky mannerisms when it comes to food.

I'm about to switch to a third because you refuses to eat what we have now. She won't overeat, she never under eats, but I pay attention to how her body responds to the food she's eating. When I switch to hills adult she had a lot of gas and slowly stop eating the food. 

I have her on bark eats now, and while there's no issue with gas or otherwise and she seems perfectly healthy she slowly stopped eating the food. To be fair, this is also after they change their packaging from individual day meals to the large bag. This could have affected the overall quality.

I've tested out a few other brands did some research into them and didn't like what I saw. And I'm settling on Purina pro plan, she liked it, it was easy enough for her to eat and healthy. And most of all one of my friends who has done a lot of research into good dog foods as well as been on the end of having a grain-free diet for their dog which of course they will never go back to.

Ok ... Am I missing something about WSAVA? ,elsnyd,"You can find a guide for pet owners as a PDF of the WSAVA website about what to look for in a brand and a food. I send this home a lot with pet owners in my clinic. I mention the (US) big 5, but ultimately I give them guide and let them choose. 

That's said, the big 5 are the standard that most brands are trying to meet through whatever ways they decide. The big thing I worry about with some of the boutique diets is the sourcing of ingredients. Purina, Hill's, and Royal Canin have very strict guidelines about where their ingredients come from and how they are transported and stored.

"Acana, Zignature, Taste of the Wild, 4Health, Earthborn Holistic, Blue Buffalo, Fromm, Merrick, Nutrish, Nutro, Orijen, and other brands most often had complaints associated with nutritional Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)",Varishta,"There’s a lot to touch on here, but to address some scattered points-

-We are always learning more about factors that affect nutrient absorption and utilization. You want to know where a significant bulk of our knowledge on that front comes from? Research performed by the “big 5” dog/cat food companies. At this point, every commercial pet food is following guidelines based on extensive research performed by these companies. You cannot give a blanket statement that the same nutrient will always be better absorbed from a whole ingredient source vs from a supplement. Some are, some aren’t. The same nutrient isn’t even absorbed the same from two different “whole food” ingredients. Many supplements contain nutrients that are more bioavailable than that from a whole food source. Each individual one is different. The big 5 know this. They have performed many, many studies to actually CHECK the absorption and utilization of the nutrients in their diet. They can measure the amount of a nutrient going in vs coming out to see how much was absorbed. They ensure that the nutrients needed are available to the pet. THAT is what sets them well above the rest. They ensure than enough of each nutrient is available in the finished product, accounting for differences in bioavailability and changes based on how it’s processed. They can back up what they’re putting in the diets and why. Nearly every other company cannot, they formulate solely based on calculations and theory and say it works on paper, therefore it’s fine.

- It is vastly exaggerated to claim that most or even a significant portion of nutrition in these diets comes from supplements. Just because there are many supplements on an ingredients list does not mean they are a large part of the diet. The flaw of an ingredients list is that you cannot tell how much of each is there. If I season and cook a steak with 9 different spices, the ingredients list will be 9/10 things like salt, pepper, etc. But they still compose a very small proportion of the overall meal, they are not 9/10 of what I’m eating. Supplements are a small part of any diet. A dog food having something like Vit. E in the ingredients list does not mean ALL the Vit E is coming from a supplement, just that they felt some additional was needed, but they didn’t need extra of the other minerals and calories to get it from a separate whole ingredient. There is nothing wrong with that.

-Nutrient availability from whole ingredients varies widely based on how it is processed. Corn on the cob has different nutrient availability than ground corn, or corn oil. Just because a particular nutrient is present in an ingredient does not mean it is available to a pet eating it. Further, many nutrients contain factors that interfere with absorption or utilization of other nutrients. The diets causing nutritional DCM in dogs on paper contain all the nutrition a dog needs. But an as-yet unknown factor in pulse legumes is making it inadequate and causing harm. One theory is that there is something present that prevents or interferes with taurine. If these companies did extensive feeding trials before releasing their diet to market, it’s very likely the issue would have been caught and no dogs would have died. Instead, these companies choose to formulate by prioritizing emotional reaction and marketing and don’t do adequate research, using the public’s pets as their guinea pigs to test for adequacy. But these animals aren’t being monitored or health tested or observed nearly as thoroughly as pets in a feeding trial, meaning significantly more need to be harmed before it will come to public awareness, and then the company either has to admit that their poor formulation and rejection of established research killed dogs, or they have to invest heavily in denying it and trying to shift the blame (which every listed brand has chosen to do). 

-If you’re interested in learning more, some good science-based resources for learning more about dog and cat nutrition include Petfoodology from Tufts University, SkeptVet, and AllTradesDVM. There is A LOT of misinformation about pet food on the internet and much of it is very emotionally appealing and feels good to buy into. Research based sounds more boring and doesn’t have the same emotional blackmail approach, but it is by far the safer and more sound option. That is why the majority of vets advocate for it and even give it to their own pets.",1,0.141950602,unknown

Sunday Dog food is a scam and I need to switch ,alyanthea,"you could try Instinct freeze-dried! they employ a full time board-certified vet nutritionist and provide other useful information to read—with discretion—regarding their WSAVA answers. there is no such thing as WSAVA “compliance,” but the WSAVA questions and whether or not a company chooses to answer (or what their answers are) can be helpful to guide your decision.

What is the longest you’ve stood your ground with dog not eating dog food?,jocularamity,"Unpopular opinion on social media where tough love reigns: I'll not have my dogs eat *nothing* for any longer than twelve hours. If I do find us in that position, something is wrong and I need to take action. 

Healthy, exercised, relaxed adult dogs who feel good, fed an appropriate amount of a good quality food...don't skip meals. If mine skip a meal then a. they are ill, b. I have been feeding them too much so they're self regulating, c. something is actually wrong with the food, or d. something is wrong with our routines or their stress levels. 

If my finicky dog skips one meal first thing in the morning, okay fine, he's probably nauseous, knowing this specific dog.  I'll feed a tiiiiiiny cookie to relieve any empty belly nausea and offer the same food in half an hour, and if he still doesn't eat it then the food is forfeited, in the trash, that meal is skipped. 9/10 times he will eat it the second time it's offered though. This happens way less on his current food--he was nauseous more frequently on some other foods.   

If my chow hound skips a meal, she's going to the vet same day for an urgent appointment because something is seriously wrong. You have to know your dog. This would be totally out of character for her.   

If my dog who stress-skips food and needs just the right routines and rituals to eat skips a meal, I'll offer it again in an hour when he's in a better frame of mind to eat. He needs to exercise and sniff and potty and play before he's going to eat. 
   
If skipping meals is common in general though, or a dog is skipping more than one meal in a row, something is wrong. I'm calling the vet for an appointment same-week (will cancel it if it turns out not to be needed). I'm weighing them and doing the math to calculate how many calories they've been getting because maybe they're legit not needing as much as I've been giving (key indicator: if my dog is overweight or gaining unneeded weight while also refusing meals, I'm offering them too much food and need to cut way back). I'm checking for recalls, smelling the food to see how it smells, looking for bugs or mold in the bag, maybe even reading reviews for other similar experiences. I'm making notes about schedules and routines. I'm adjusting where/how I feed to minimize stress or conflict. I'm washing dishes to be sure they don't smell off. If I suspect something off with the food I'm returning it for a refund (I've lived through enough of the big recalls to give my dogs some trust and believe them if they suddenly go off a new batch of food). And I'm offering a small amount of something else bland to eat periodically if they've skipped meals out of character. Not enough to make up all of their calories for the day and really fill them up, but a little snack so their bellies aren't totally empty for too long. The nausea that comes with bile and hunger pukes for some dogs will make them even LESS likely to eat and that's a nasty reinforcing loop if they eat literally nothing for too long. 
  
One way or another though, I'm not ""giving in"" and feeding them full rations of a totally different food unless I suspect a health issue or something wrong with their regular food. I'm not adding a topper to encourage them to eat the food they refused, *ever*. Maybe they get the same meal or a snack later because I know better than to allow hunger pukes, but we never ever add goodies to refused food to make it tastier, because that directly results in more food refusal. 

When I have known dogs who refused more than one meal in a row, they all either had a medical issue (do whatever the vet says, which may involve a diet change), stress/anxiety (change the routine or the feeding location/situation), were fed too many calories so they self regulated (feed less and cut out chews/treats), or there was actually something wrong with their food and it resolved with a food change. 

So I don't give in per se, but at the same time skipping multiple meals is a problem to fix, not something I accept as normal and ride out.",1,0.042368256,chews

Garlic Oil in U.S. Purina Pro Plan but not in U.K.,Wild_Sea9484,"Hey man, idk where you're getting these sources, but in VIN it mentions that the
15to30g/kg number is for onions as far as Allium goes. And that garlic is 3 to 5 times more potent than onions.  These are fresh numbers, if you're talking about granulated or powdered the potency is much stronger. 


So it's more like 3 to 5g/kg which is not a large amount. Your 25kg dog (who is pretty big by the way) could have severe heinz body anemia after eating 1 bulb. Or 1 tablespoon of granulated garlic. A 3 to 5 kg dog would need much less. Sometimes a single clove would do. 


The food in PPP has minute minute amounts no where near the numbers. Were talking mcg not grams. 


Now this is to be taken with a grain of salt. I would not trust treats that have garlic as it's unlike a veterinary nutritionist has reviewed the numbers or formulation on dollar store treats or chews you see at costco. ",1,0.175396825,chews

dry kibble for adopted shelter dog who is emaciated,jocularamity,"If she is emaciated after being fed well (I assume the shelter fed her enough?) for many months, there could easily be a medical condition causing her poor weight. Has she been to your vet yet?

My first consideration would be to avoid sudden changes. Keep feeding whatever she is used to right now, ideally in several small meals a day (but enough that it adds up to what the bag recommends for her ideal weight). Sudden changes can cause diarrhea or vomiting which is the last thing you want in an already emaciated dog. 

My second consideration would be to feed her in ways she doesn't find stressful, so she can start to decompress. Let her eat in peace, without noise or commotion nearby, with no social pressure or required hand feeding. 

Feed several small meals of whatever she's already used to every day. Get her in with your vet and get their recommendation on diet and specifically how many calories they recommend she should get in a day. That will tell you how much to feed (the food bag will tell you how many calories are in each measuring cup of food). Feed enough calories for her healthy weight, not her current low weight. 

Then if you change foods, do it gradually over the course of a couple of weeks, starting with just a little of the new food every day and gradually increasing. No sudden cold turkey changes. 

I would aim for high-ish calorie but not insanely high calorie. Think like 400-450 or so calories per cup. Not like high octane sled dog fuel with tons of calories packed in (there are some brands that really go wild with high calorie formulas, but I wouldn't go that direction unless your vet tells you to). I wouldn't want to go super rich in terms of high fat, and risk more belly upset. 

Examples in a couple of different price brackets: 

Classic Purina Dog Chow: 416 calories per cup of food

That study only had 20 dogs complete the study, there were no statically significant differences in the two groups, the two groups allowed for massive variation in breed/age, and the only diet that even had a suggested difference (again, not statistically significant anyways) was the isolated Soy diet. 

So I stand by my original comment, which is directly supported by the study that you linked. Hyper concentrated soy diets are not studied sufficiently to say with 100% certainty that there is no difference, but there is not a significantly concerning difference at the 1 year mark based on a tiny preliminary study.

First time dog owner,carlab70,"Switch food slowly from what the puppy is currently eating to whatever food you decide.  Just increase the ratio of new food to old food over the course of the week until fully transitioned. Many dogs get tummy upset and diarrhea if you switch too quickly. Puppy food should be fed for the first year.  

Also, at 9 weeks of age you should be feeding smaller more frequent meals - I think 4 meals a day is typical, and as the puppy gets older you can cut back to 3 meals and then 2 meals.  I raised an Aussie Shepard last year and she was transitioned to two meals a day by the age of 6 months. Some folks transition over long period of time but not always possible depending on schedule.

Enjoy the puppy years!!! They pass quickly and then all if a sudden your puppy is a big dog! It is overwhelming, and not just in regards to food. 

Make sure to enroll in basic training and pay attention to dog socializing needs at an early age. By 12 weeks of age your puppy should be exposed to many people and environments.

First time dog owner,jocularamity,"- start out feeding whatever the breeder or rescue is feeding.  Exactly the same brand, formula, flavor, no change at all. 
- if you want to change. Do it gradually with a slow transition, and dont start transitioning until you see at least a few days of good poops on the food the puppy is used to.
- If you want to switch after they settle in, pro plan is fine! 
- The important thing is it needs to be formulated for growth. The AAFCO statement is what tells you which life stages the food is okay for. In pro plan's lines that means it needs to be a ""puppy"" food or a ""sport"" food. Their regular adult foods won't work for puppy growth, so you don't even have to worry about all those adult formula options.
- I would start with pro plan puppy food. Don't worry about pro plan large breed puppy food unless you're getting a puppy who will grow up to be big as an adult, which is unlikely with the breed mix you mentioned. They also have a ""sensitive skin and stomach"" line for puppies or large breed puppies using different proteins like lamb or salmon, but not every dog really needs that. I would see how it goes with the regular chicken-based puppy food first.
- I wouldn't bother with sport food unless you're planning on your dog being highly active, like with a working job or a serious career sport.

First time dog owner,KillerSparks,"As the other response said, stay away from fad diets and boutique brands like Rachel Ray, Farmer's Dog, etc. The proven brands that do not cause any health issues and meet or exceed all needs are Purina, Royal Canin, Iams, and Hill's. Pro Plan is great, which variation you get can honestly depend on your dogs preference. My dog goes crazy for the little soft pieces that come in the shredded chicken bags. Your puppy most likely doesn't need the sensitive varieties, and if you're ever unsure, you can always mention it a vet appointment.

How much to feed varies for every dog individually. I always start out giving a new puppy as much as they want, keeping track of how much that is, and then only adjusting downwards slowly if they start to get fat. Most of mine eat as much as they want their whole lives and stay a healthy weight. The exception is a Chihuahua who gets fat easily and has a very closely monitored food intake 🤣. Make sure to feed 2-3 times a day, not just once. Especially leaning towards 3 times a day while they're still a puppy.

As far as switching from puppy to adult, you usually switch when they stop growing significantly, between 1.5-2 years. It doesn't hurt the dog to stay on puppy food longer, it just has more than they probably need and they might get fat easier.

Does blue Buffalo meet the WASVA standards?,caligirl_ksay,"Anecdotally I used to feed my dogs blue buffalo and their coats were horrible, rough and bleached out, they also always had soft stool and it never seemed to get better.

My GSD also had a huge issue eating her poo on blue buffalo which hasn’t happened at all on pro plan. I also worked at a vet for six years and our purina diets were so effective in keeping the dogs healthy and off meds, even diabetic dogs could switch to a diabetic formula and they had great results, with less diabetic issues and medicines.

Kirkland Brand,jocularamity," Research I've read lately (within the past two years or so) seems to be leaning more toward a focus on pulse-rich or pulse-based diets.

E.g. as a high level summary https://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2023/02/diet-associated-dilated-cardiomyopathy-the-cause-is-not-yet-known-but-it-hasnt-gone-away/ mentions potatoes and sweet potatoes but focuses more on pulses as a concern, compared with earlier updates than really didn't differentiate and lumped all BEG together.

He started vomiting and wouldn’t stop for three hours, just bile mostly, so I brought him in again & they gave him IV fluids & an injections to stop him from vomiting. They did barium X-rays but didn’t see a blockage. He’s home with me now, but he’s not allowed to have anything but crushed ice. Just wondering if your dog had some of these types of symptoms and how it resolved for you?",1,-0.02,unknown

A vet we had in another city recommended them. Best price is from Costco.com. 

I will also backup bully sticks as an effective natural chew.",1,0.34,Chews
Are there any dog food websites that offer brands at a lower rate?,atlantisgate,If you’re buying something at a significantly lower price from an unknown retailer the likelihood you’re buying improperly stored or expired food skyrockets. Your best bet is to keep an eye out for coupons at reputable retailers or switch to a cheaper food option,8,0.44375,unknown
"Diamond Naturals, Causing sickness",Significant-Blood-94,"My dog is still sick and this is going on week 4 and 1200 in vet bills. I have to hand feed my dog the tiny bit of food she will eat and I have been putting bone broth in a syringe to get her some nutrients. We have to give her nausea meds from the vet or she throws up undigested food or bile. She has went from 40lbs to 31lbs. Diarrhea has stopped but she doesn’t have an appetite at all, they asked for proof of purchase for a refund, sent but I don’t care about a refund for the dog food. I want my dog to get better! I feel like I’m literally watching her die and I can’t stand it. My other dog is a puppy so she was eating diamond puppy food, she hasn’t had any problems but we are switching her food as well. They can’t tell us there isn’t a problem with their food when there are so many of us that are having the SAME thing happen to our dogs! I HOPE we all have the same lot number so maybe the FDA will do something. I haven’t heard back from them but I also filed with them this past weekend after I found this thread and saw reviews on chewy.com and Amazon about this food. Prayers for all of our dogs 😩",1,0.003968254,puppy food
Dog parent guilt is real 🥲,OrganicAd2430,"Well, I guess the truth is.. even if you try and do all the right things, nothing is guaranteed. You have to do what’s best for your puppy. The point of my post was to ultimately share that I learned to “feed the dog in front of me”. I don’t know the details or the politics of how hills recall was handled or how it happened but a recall could realistically happen to any dog food brand. 

It’s important to do your own research and make changes based on how your individual dog is doing.. not doing what’s mainstream or what only makes you feel good and not your puppy.

I was feeding my dog a kibble that made me feel good but didn’t make him feel good (diarrhea, mucusy stools). So I let go of my prior thinking to give him the food that makes him feel good instead of forcing him to eat what I wanted him to because I liked the aesthetic or mission of the brand. 

I do think it’s possible to find something that works for your dog and you.. and makes you both feel good!! 

If Hills is not it for you, that’s okay. You’ll figure out through your own trial and research what is good for you both.",2,0.471428571,ultima
Dog hates Royal Canin - any recommendations?,sffood,"[The Honest Kitchen](https://www.chewy.com/honest-kitchen-grain-free-chicken/dp/177086?utm_source=google-product&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=f&utm_content=The%20Honest%20Kitchen&utm_term=&gclid=Cj0KCQjw8eOLBhC1ARIsAOzx5cHDaFoocsz2V_Xv8Q6wjHbuuASFoyTabDzUJaNZMyTT5lrhHI0hKmMaAmk8EALw_wcB) is one that my picky dog likes. I have no idea why because to my nose, other food smells so much more enticing.

[Farmina](https://www.chewy.com/farmina-nd-ancestral-grain-chicken/dp/202214) is also one of our favorites. I tend to go back and forth between the two.

My current puppy is on [Merrick Puppy Food](https://www.chewy.com/merrick-grain-free-puppy-chicken/dp/227210). Pretty good, and he likes it — but not as much as the Nutrisource the rescue fed him. Haven’t yet decided what I’ll feed next but I can’t wait for the two to be on the same food!",2,0.2125,Puppy Food
